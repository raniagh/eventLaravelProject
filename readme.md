# Laravel 5.2 Multi-Auth

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-1.0-brightgreen.svg)]()

A basic example of how to user the built in Multi-Auth to allow logging in of both admin and end users.

## User Models

Both the Admin and User models are under the ```App\Models``` namespace and the ```app\config\auth.php``` file has been updated to reflect this.

## Views

The Admin and User views have been seperated out, so they can be displayed independently and provide a noticeable difference between the look and feel to the site.

## Additional packages

The base package comes with the addition of the following packages:
* barryvdh/laravel-debugbar

## Install

Please see [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) for more information on how to install.
